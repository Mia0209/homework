我的第一次作业  

1) Computer<br/>
A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. 
电子计算机，亦称电脑，计算机是一种利用数字电子技术，根据一系列指令指示其自动执行任意算术或逻辑操作串行的设备。

2) Computer science<br/>
Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to, information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems 
计算机科学（英语：computer science，有时缩写为CS）是系统性研究信息与计算的理论基础以及它们在计算机系统中如何实现（英语：implementation）与应用的实用技术的学科。

3) Software<br/>
Computer software, or simply software, is a generic term that refers to a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work. 
软件（英语：software）是一系列按照特定顺序组织的电脑数据和指示，是电脑中的非有形部分。

4) Software engineering<br/>
Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method. 
应用计算机科学理论和技术以及工程管理原则和方法，按预算和进度，实现满足用户要求的软件产品的定义、开发、和维护的工程或进行研究的学科。

5) Alan Turing<br/>
Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science a

6) Moore’s law<br/>
Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decate.
