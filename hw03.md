**1)Methods of complements**  

In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers.

The nines' complement of a number is formed by replacing each digit with nine minus that digit. To subtract a decimal number y (the subtrahend) from another number x (the minuend) two methods may be used:

In the first method the nines' complement of x is added to y. Then the nines' complement of the result obtained is formed to produce the desired result.

In the second method the nines' complement of y is added to x and one is added to the sum. The leading digit '1' of the result is then discarded. Discarding the initial '1' is especially convenient on calculators or computers that use a fixed number of digits: there is nowhere for it to go so it is simply lost during the calculation. The nines' complement plus one is known as the ten's complement.

The method of complements can be extended to other number bases (radices); in particular, it is used on most digital computers to perform subtraction, represent negative numbers in base 2 or binary arithmetic and test underflow and overflow in calculation.  

**2)Byte**  
  
  The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer  and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.

The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size – byte-sizes from 1 to 48 bits are known to have been used in the past. Early character encoding systems often used six bits, and machines using six-bit and nine-bit bytes were common into the 1960s. These machines most commonly had memory words of 12, 24, 36, 48 or 60 bits, corresponding to two, four, six, eight or 10 six-bit bytes. In this era, bytes in the instruction stream were often referred to as syllables, before the term byte became common.  

字节（港澳台作位元组，英语：Byte），通常用作计算机信息计量单位，不分数据类型。 一个字节代表八个比特（港澳台作位元，英语：Bit）。从历史的观点上，“字节”表示用于编码单个字符所需要的比特数量。历史上字节长度曾基于硬件为1-48比特不等，最初通常使用6比特或9比特为一字节。今日事实标准以8比特作为一字节，因8为二进制整数。

八个二进位在一些规范（例如工业标准、计算机网络、电信技术等）中常被称为Octet（八位组）。

Byte（字节）可缩写成B，例如MB表示Megabyte；Bit（比特）可缩写成b（小写），例如Mb表示Megabit。  

**3)Integer**  

An integer (from the Latin integer meaning "whole")[note 1] is a number that can be written without a fractional component. For example, 21, 4, 0, and −2048 are integers, while 9.75, 5 1/2, and √2 are not.

The set of integers consists of zero (0), the positive natural numbers (1, 2, 3, …), also called whole numbers or counting numbers, and their additive inverses (the negative integers, i.e., −1, −2, −3, …). The set of integers is often denoted by a boldface Z ("Z") or blackboard bold {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } \mathbb {Z}  (Unicode U+2124 ℤ) standing for the German word Zahlen ([ˈtsaːlən], "numbers").  

整数，是序列 {\displaystyle \{\ldots ,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\ldots \}} {\displaystyle \{\ldots ,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\ldots \}}中所有的数的统称，包括负整数、零（0）与正整数。和自然数一样，整数也是一个可数的无限集合。这个集合在数学上通常表示粗体 {\displaystyle Z} Z或 {\displaystyle \mathbb {Z} } \mathbb {Z} ，源于德语单词Zahlen（意为“数”）的首字母。  

**4)Floating poing**

The term floating point refers to the fact that a number's radix point (decimal point, or, more commonly in computers, binary point) can "float"; that is, it can be placed anywhere relative to the significant digits of the number. This position is indicated as the exponent component, and thus the floating-point representation can be thought of as a kind of scientific notation.

A floating-point system can be used to represent, with a fixed number of digits, numbers of different orders of magnitude: e.g. the distance between galaxies or the diameter of an atomic nucleus can be expressed with the same unit of length. The result of this dynamic range is that the numbers that can be represented are not uniformly spaced; the difference between two consecutive representable numbers grows with the chosen scale.

1） 证明  

2） Int8_t x = - 017 为-15，转为二进制即11110001，转为八进制即361。

1）C程序：int8_t x = -0x1f; int y = x; 请用16进制描述变量 x 和 y，并说明 int y = x 的计算过程。

x = -31，用二进制表示为11100001，用十六进制表示为，0xe1，y占四个字节，在进行赋值计算时x会自动变为4字节，并用符号位的数字补位，即为(1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110 0001)，十进制也是-31，在转换为十六进制是(0xffffffe1)。
